This mod has been dedicated to the [Lethal Company Modding community repo](https://github.com/LethalCompanyModding/UnityDebuggerAssistant) and may be maintained by any willing community member with a github account.

## Current Features

- Listens for Harmony or MonoMod Patches
- Outputs a list of all plugins that modify a specific method when an Exception is thrown targeting that method

## How Does This Help Me?

It might not help you directly but when you go to ask for support and a kind and helpful person asks for your logs this plugin will output more debug information before each exception is written out. It will make their life easier and they will thank you.
